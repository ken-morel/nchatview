Hello!

nchat is a telegram and whatsapp client I personaly use for viewing my whatsapp messages(starts faster than whatsapp web and I can use it in tty).

This is a simple python script meant to permit you view file attachments calling either:
- zathura for pdf's.
- imagemagick and sixel to view attached images directly from you terminal(A supported terminal like foot).
- neovim for md and txt files.
- and fallsback to zdg-open.
thus depends on zathura, imagemagick, and neovim.

this is at base a python project you should easily be able to setup


```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ken-morel/nchatview.git
```


Or

```bash
pip install https://github.com/ken-morel/nchatview/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```
```
```
